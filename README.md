# Home-AssistantConfig
Configuration for my Home Assistant.

I currently have a Raspberry Pi B3+, Smartthings Hub (along with several lights and buttons), chromecasts, and Google Homes.

My goal is to automate things that get in the way, but also allow things to be physically controlled when needed.

WIP.
